#Configurations

Besides files you can also store non binary data items in RavenFS. It allows you to store JSON formatted items called *configurations*. 
The usage of .Net Client API allows you to save any object because under the hood it is serialized to JSON. All methods to manage configuration items you will
find in [configuration commands](client-api/commands/configurations/set-key).

##Example

This is the example of the configuration item stored under `Raven/Synchronization/Destinations` which is used internally to handle [a file synchronization](./synchronization/how-it-works):

{CODE-BLOCK:json}
{
    "Destinations": 
	[
		{
			"ServerUrl": "http://localhost:8080",
			"Username": null,
			"Password": null,
			"Domain": null,
			"ApiKey": null,
			"FileSystem": "Northwind",
			"Enabled": true
		}
	]
}
{CODE-BLOCK/}
