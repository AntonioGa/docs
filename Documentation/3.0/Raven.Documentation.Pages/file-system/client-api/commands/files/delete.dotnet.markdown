{INFO: Delete on server side}
To delete a file RavenFS needs to remove a lot of information related to this file. In order to respond to the user quickly
the file is just renamed and a delete marker is added to its metadata. The actual delete is performed by [a periodic task](../../../server/background-tasks),
which ensures that all requested deletes will be accomplished even in the presence of server restarts in the middle.
