#What is a files store?

A files store is the main file system client API object that ensures an access to RavenFS instance. It is an equivalent of [a document store](../../client-api/what-is-a-document-store) for a file system.

The files store is designated to work with a single RavenDB server where there can be multiple file systems. By default it performs actions against a default
file system that has to be provided during initialization, but it is also able to work with any existing file system on associated server.

The basic interface is `IFilesStore`. Currently its only implementation is `FilesStore` which communicates with the server by sending HTTP requests.

The files store ensures the access to the following client API features:

* Session
* Commands
* Changes API
* Listeners
