##How to create a data subscription?

In order to create a data subscription you have to specify the criteria that documents must match to be incorporated into subscription results.

{CODE:java create_1@ClientApi\DataSubscriptions\DataSubscriptions.java /}

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **clazz** | Class | Use for creating strongly typed subscription. |
| **criteria** | SubscriptionCriteria | Subscription criteria. |
| **database** | String | Name of database to create a data subscription. If `null`, default database configured in DocumentStore will be used. |

| Return value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| long | A data subscription identifier. |

In `SubscriptionCriteria`, where you can specify the following filters:

* _KeyStartsWith_ - a document id must starts with a specified prefix,
* _BelongsToAnyCollection_ - list of collections that the subscription deals with,
* _PropertiesMatch_ - map of field names and related values that a document must have,
* _PropertiesNotMatch_ - map of field names and related values that a document must not have.

_BelongsToAnyCollection_ will be automatically filled in by a single value based on the entity type (see [findTypeTagName](../configuration/conventions/identifier-generation/global#findtypetagname-and-finddynamictagname) convention), when using override with clazz parameter.

The execution of `create` method will create a data subscription in a database and return its identifier (you can see `Raven/Subscriptions/[id]` documents in the database).
This identifier is needed to open the subscription so you need to keep that information to be able to make use of it later.

###Example I

{CODE:java create_2@ClientApi\DataSubscriptions\DataSubscriptions.java /}

In this case we want to get all documents that id starts with `employees/` but does not contain `Address.City` field with value `Seattle`.
Note that although we specified `employees/` prefix id it doesn't mean we will get documents belonging to the same collection. It can return a developer (`employees/developers/1`)
as well as a manager (`employees/managers/1`), anyhow we can be sure that none of them is living in `Seattle`.

###Example II

{CODE:java create_3@ClientApi\DataSubscriptions\DataSubscriptions.java /}

In this case, it will give us all the orders, but only those which are handled by `employees/1` employee. Here we used generic type criteria, so we can specify properties filtering in strongly typed way.
Also we can be sure that all returned documents belong to `Orders` collection (so we will be able to open the strongly typed subscription).
