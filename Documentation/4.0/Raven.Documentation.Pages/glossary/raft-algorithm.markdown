# Glossary : Raft Consensus Algorithm

### What is Raft?
Raft is a [distributed consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) algorithm, designed to be understandable and durable. 
In general, the algorithm is useful when we want to order the events that happen on a distributed system in different nodes.

In case or RavenDB, Raft is used to coordinate the execution of cluster-wide operations over the nodes. 
This means, that if we want to create a database in a cluster, and this means creating the database on all cluter nodes,
the Raft will be used to make sure that the database creation is executed in at least (n/2) + 1 nodes. (quorum of nodes)
