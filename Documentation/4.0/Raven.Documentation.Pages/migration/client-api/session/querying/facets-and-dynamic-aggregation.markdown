# How to migrate Facets and Dynamic Aggregation from 3.x?

Facets and Dynamic Aggregation have been merged into a single feature and are now also a part of [RQL]().

## Facets

Facets are now divided into two types:

- `Facet` where shole spectrum of results will regenrate single outcome,
- `RangeFacet` gives you the ability to split the whole spectrum of results into smaller ranges

`FacetSetup` document also now splits the facets into two properties. One containing `Facets`, the other one containing `RangeFacets`.

### Example

| 3.x |
|:---:|
| {CODE facets_1_0@Migration\ClientApi\Session\Querying\Facets.cs /} |

| 4.0 |
|:---:|
| {CODE facets_1_1@Migration\ClientApi\Session\Querying\Facets.cs /} |

---

## Querying

All of the method were substituted with `AggregateBy` and `AggregateUsing`.

### Example I

| 3.x |
|:---:|
| {CODE facets_2_0@Migration\ClientApi\Session\Querying\Facets.cs /} |

| 4.0 |
|:---:|
| {CODE facets_2_1@Migration\ClientApi\Session\Querying\Facets.cs /} |

### Example II

| 3.x |
|:---:|
| {CODE facets_3_0@Migration\ClientApi\Session\Querying\Facets.cs /} |

| 4.0 |
|:---:|
| {CODE facets_3_1@Migration\ClientApi\Session\Querying\Facets.cs /} |
