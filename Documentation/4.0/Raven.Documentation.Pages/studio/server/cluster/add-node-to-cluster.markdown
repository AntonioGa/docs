## Adding a Node to a Cluster
---

{NOTE: }
When a server is started for the first time, it is in a `passive` state.  

Performing any RAFT command (such as listed below) will make the server become part of a cluster.

* Adding a license
* Creating a database on this server
* Adding another node to this server cluster (will cause both to be part of the same cluster)
{NOTE/}

### Add Node to the Cluster

**1.** Enter the URL of the server for the new node  
**2.** Decide if you will add the new node as a `member` -or- as a `watcher` (difference explained in [Cluster View](cluster-view))  
**3.** Click to use all available nodes -or- Enter the number of cores to be assigned for this node  
**4.** Click _Test connection_ to test the connection for the above url entered  

When done, click *Save* to add this server as a node to the cluster

### A Cluster with 2 nodes

Now your cluster contains 2 nodes:  

* The server running on _localhost:8081_ shows as Node A and is the `Leader` of the cluster.  
* The server running on _localhost:8082_ shows as Node B and is a `Member` of the cluster.

{NOTE: }
 More nodes can be added as needed.
