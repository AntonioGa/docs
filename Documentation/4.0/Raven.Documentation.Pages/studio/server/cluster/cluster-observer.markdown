## Cluster Observer
---

{PANEL}
**The Cluster Observer is a supervising component in the cluster.  
It monitors the nodes health and adjusts the nodes state in the the Database Group accordingly.**  

For each database, it sets the node state within the Database Group, thus determining the Database Group Topology.  

The Observer is always running on the `Leader` node, it requires consensus to operate.  
Thus, if there is no Leader, no Database Group Topology decisions can be made.

{NOTE: }
**Note:** Don't confuse the Database Group Topology with the Cluster Topology:  
For more info about nodes types and states in the **Cluster** see [Cluster View](cluster-view)  
For more info about nodes types and states in the **Database Group** see [Database Group](../../../../please-update-me-later)

{NOTE: }
####**When a new node is added to a Database Group:**  

1. The Observer will add the node as `Promotable`.
2. Once the node has caught up with the state of the Database Group - fully updated with the database data and finished indexing the last data sent to it,  
   the Observer will promote it to a full `Member`.  
   See detailed explanation of the Member actions and tasks within a Database Group in ... TBD - add link when page is created ... 
{NOTE/}

{NOTE: }
####**When the Observer notices that a node is down ,or unresponsive, it will:**  

1. Set the node to a `Rehab` state.  
2. If 'Allow Dynamic Node Distribution' is set, (see [Create Database](..\databases\create-new-database\general-flow))  
   then after a pre-configured time period, the Observer will add another node from the cluster to the Database Group in order to keep the replication factor.  
   The replacement node will be set to `Promotable` and will start catching up data from the other nodes in the group.  
3. The Observer will Update the Database Group Topology with these changes so that each node in the Database Group will re-calculate his work assignments.  
{NOTE/}

{NOTE: }
####**When the `Rhab` node is responsive again:**  

1. If a replacement node was added when the node was down: (Dynamic Node distribution was set)  

   * If the replacing node is fully updated (in a `Member` state)  
     then the Observer will delete the node that came back from the Database Group Topology.

   * If the replacing node is still Not fully updated (still in `Promotable` state)  
     then the Observer will set the `Rehab` node to `Promotable` so that it starts updating.  
     At this point the replication factor is greater than was set for the relevant database,  
     so the Observer will go ahead and delete the extra node, 
     either the replacement one or the Rehab one - whoever is the last to be fully updated.  

    * Either way, deletion of the a node will Not occur before the Observer verifies that all 
      data from the node to be deleted was replicated to the Database Group members.
<br/>
2. If no replacement node was added: (Dynamic Node Distribution was Not set)  

   * The `Rehab` node will start catching up data from the other members in the relevant Database Group.  
     Note: the node can be part of multiple Databases Groups....
   * Once it is fully updated, the Observer will directly promote it to a full `Member` in the Database Group Topology.

![Figure 2. Refratsh and Suspend](images/cluster-observer-2.png "Refreshing Log and Suspending Observer")

### 1. Refreshing Data
{NOTE: }
Click `Refresh` to get latest actions done by the Observer

**When a new Leader is elected:**  

* `Term` value will increase  
* The Observer will move to be in the new Leader  
* All previous log data will not be kept - so clicking `Refresh` will start a new log  
{NOTE/}


### 2. Suspending the Cluster Observer
{NOTE: }
**Be careful with this option**  

Use this only when you don't want the Observer to make any changes to the Database Group Topology  
i.e. when taking nodes down for maintenance
