# Bulk Insert : How to work with bulk insert operation?

One of the features that is particularly useful when inserting large amount of data is `bulk inserting`. This is an optimized time-saving approach with few drawbacks that will be described later.

## Syntax

{CODE bulk_inserts_1@ClientApi\BulkInsert\BulkInserts.cs /}

| Parameters | | |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| **database** | string | Name of database for which bulk operation should be performed. If `null` then `DefaultDatabase` from DocumentStore will be used. |

| Return Value | |
| ------------- | ----- |
| BulkInsertOperation| Instance of BulkInsertOperation used for interaction. |

# BulkInsertOperation

### Methods

| Signature | Description |
| ----------| ----- |
| **void Abort()** | Abort the operation |
| **void Store(object entity, IMetadataDictionary metadata = null)** | store the entity, identifier will be generated automatically on client-side. Optional, metadata can be provided for the stored entity. |
| **void Store(object entity, string id, IMetadataDictionary metadata = null)** | store the entity, with `id` parameter to explicitly declare the entity identifier. Optional, metadata can be provided for the stored entity.|
| **void StoreAsync(object entity, IMetadataDictionary metadata = null)** | store the entity in an async manner, identifier will be generated automatically on client-side. Optional, metadata can be provided for the stored entity. |
| **void StoreAsync(object entity, string id, IMetadataDictionary metadata = null)** | store the entity in an async manner, with `id` parameter to explicitly declare the entity identifier. Optional, metadata can be provided for the stored entity.|
| **void Dispose()** | Dispose an object |

## Limitations

There are several limitations to the API:

* The bulk insert operation is broken into batches, each batch is treated in its own transaction so the whole operation isn't treated under a single transaction.
* Bulk insert is not thread safe, a single bulk insert should not be accessed concurrently. The use of multiple bulk inserts, on the same client, concurrently is supported.

## Example
{PANEL: Create bulk insert}
Here we create a bulk insert operation and inserting a million documents of type Employee
{CODE-TABS}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:sync bulk_inserts_4@ClientApi\BulkInsert\BulkInserts.cs /}
{CODE-TAB:csharp:async bulk_inserts_5@ClientApi\BulkInsert\BulkInserts.cs /}
{CODE-TABS/}
{PANEL/}
