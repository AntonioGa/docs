#Conventions Related to Serialization

##CustomizeJsonSerializer

If you need to modify `JsonSerializer` object used by the client when sending entities to the server you can register a customization action:

{CODE customize_json_serializer@ClientApi\Configuration\Serialization.cs /}

##DeserializeEntityFromBlittable

In order to customize the entity deserialization from blittable JSON you can use define `DeserializeEntityFromBlittable` implementation:

{CODE DeserializeEntityFromBlittable@ClientApi\Configuration\Serialization.cs /}

##JsonContractResolver

The default `JsonContractResolver` used by RavenDB will serialize all properties and all public fields. You can change it by providing own implementation of `IContractResolver` interface:

{CODE json_contract_resolver@ClientApi\Configuration\Serialization.cs /}

{CODE custom_json_contract_resolver@ClientApi\Configuration\Serialization.cs /}

You can also customize behavior of the default resolver by inheriting from `DefaultRavenContractResolver` and overriding specific methods.

{CODE custom_json_contract_resolver_based_on_default@ClientApi\Configuration\Serialization.cs /}

##PreserveDocumentPropertiesNotFoundOnModel

Controls whatever properties that were not de-serialized to an object properties will be preserved 
during saving a document again. If `false`, those properties will be removed when the document will be saved. Default: `true`.

{CODE preserve_doc_props_not_found_on_model@ClientApi\Configuration\Serialization.cs /}

##BulkInsert.TrySerializeEntityToJsonStream

For the bulk insert you can configure custom serialization implementation by providing `TrySerializeEntityToJsonStream`:

{CODE TrySerializeEntityToJsonStream@ClientApi\Configuration\Serialization.cs /}


##Numbers (de)serialization

RavenDB client supports out of the box all common numeric value types: `int`, `long`, `double`, `decimal` etc.  
Note that although the (de)serialization of `decimals` is fully supported, there are [server side limitations](../../server/kb/numbers-in-ravendb) to numbers in that range.  
Other number types like `BigInteger` must be treated using custom (de)serialization.
