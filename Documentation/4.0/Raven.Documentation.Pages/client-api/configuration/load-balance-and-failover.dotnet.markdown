# Conventions : Load Balance & Failover

{NOTE: }

###ReadBalanceBehavior

* This convention gets or sets the default load-balancing behaviour of ***Read*** requests done from the client to RavenDB cluster.  

* The method selected in the convention determines which node the client's _RequestExecuter_ will send the ***Read*** requests to,  
  and which node to **failover** to in case of issues with the ***Read*** request.  

* Note: ***Write*** requests will always access the [Preferred Node](../../client-api/configuration/load-balance-and-failover#preferred-node) calculated by the client.

{PANEL: ReadBalanceBehavior Options}

  * `None`  
    * Load-balance: No load balancing will occur. The client will always select the _preferred node_.  
    * Failover: The client will failover nodes in the order they appear in the _topology nodes list_.  
      Note: The list can be reordered, see [Database Group Actions](../../studio/database/settings/manage-database-group#database-group-topology---actions).  

  * `RoundRobin`  
    * Load-balance: For each _Read_ request, the client will address the next node from the _topology nodes list_.  
    * Failover: In case of a failure, the client will try the next node in the round robin order. 

  * `FastestNode`  
    * Load-balance: _Read_ request will go to the fastest node.  
      The fastest node is determined by a [Speed Test](../../client-api/cluster/speed-test).  
    * Failover: In case of a failure, speed test will be triggered again and in the meantime, the client will use the _preferred node_.

{PANEL: Preferred Node}

* The preferred node is selected by simply going over the _topology nodes list_ and returning the first node that has not had any errors.  

* If all nodes are in a failure state then the _first_ node in the list is returned, the user would get an error or recover if the error was transient.

{PANEL: Session Usage}

* When using `RoundRobin` or `FastestNode` it might happen that the next [session](../../client-api/session/opening-a-session) you open will access a different node.  

* In most cases, a short delay in replicating changes to all nodes in the cluster is acceptable.  
  But, if you need to ensure that the next request will be able to immediately read what you just wrote, 
  you need to use [write assurance](../../client-api/session/saving-changes#waiting-for-replication---write-assurance).
