# Setting up authentication and authorization

Authentication and authorization is based on [client X.509 certificates](../server/security/authorization/security-clearance-and-permissions).

`Certificate` property allows to pass certificate which will be used by RavenDB client to connect to server. 

{NOTE If your RavenDB instance is running on 'https' then your application has to use a client certificate in order to be able to access the server. You can find more information [here](../server/security/overview). /}



## Example I

{CODE client_cert@ClientApi\Certificate.cs /}
