# Manage Your Server : Global Configuration
This feature allows you to define the behavior of the system once, and have it apply to all your databases, 
and using the RavenDB Cluster option, you can apply it across all you nodes in on go. 
You can configure global behavior and override it on individual databases.

You can configure global behavior for the following bundles:      
`Periodic export` - read more about periodic export configuration [here](../overview/settings/periodic-export).   
`Replication` - read more about replication configuration [here](../overview/settings/replication).   
`SQL Replication` - read more about SQL replication configuration [here](../overview/settings/sql-replication).   
`Quotas` - read more about quotas configuration [here](../overview/settings/quotas).
