# Tasks : Toggle Indexing

This simple view grants you the ability to pause the indexing and the reducing process. Note that information concerning the pausing is not persisted so restarting the server will re-enable indexing.

Current status, `Mapping only`, `Mapping & Reducing` or `Paused`, is displayed under the `Enable Reducing` and `Disable Reducing` buttons.
