#Recovering from Esent errors 

##Symptoms: 
- RavenDB server side error messages like:
    - `Secondary index is corrupt. The database must be defragmented`
    - `System.InvalidOperationException: Could not open transactional storage`

##Cause:
An error in Esent's file.

##Resolution:
Run Esent Utility for recovering from errors. There are two approaches to recover a corrupted database:

- Recovery - a loss-less operation that tries to recover the Esent file (`esentutl /r RVN /l logs /s system`)
- Repair - a more aggressive approach that may cause data loss (`esentutl /p Data`)

 In both cases, at the end, the defragmentation should be performed (`esentutl /d Data`)

Equivalent options for a file system:

- Recovery - `esentutl /r RFS /l logs /s system`
- Repair - `esentutl /p Data.ravenfs`
- Defragment - `esentutl /d Data.ravenfs`
