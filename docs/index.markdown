This is the official RavenDB documentation, _currently in a Beta run_. It is not considered complete, but it is continously being worked on, and is very up to date.

If you find any errors or would like to ask for clarifications, please ask in our mailing list. Any feedback welcome.

The sources for the documentation are available from [https://github.com/ravendb/docs](https://github.com/ravendb/docs). Feel free to fork the documentation base and offer updates.
