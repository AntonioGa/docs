# Adding RavenDB through NuGet

## What is nuget?

From the nuget website:

<blockquote>
NuGet is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to add, remove, and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio projects that use the .NET Framework. When you add a library or tool, NuGet copies files to your solution and automatically makes whatever changes are needed in your project, such as adding references and changing your app.config or web.config file. When you remove a library, NuGet removes files and reverses whatever changes it made in your project so that no clutter is left.
</blockquote>

You can find more on how to start using nuget [in their website](http://docs.nuget.org/).

## Adding RavenDB through NuGet

We have a bunch of NuGet packages that you can take advantage of in order to consume RavenDB in your project.

// TBD: Show a list of the packages that we, and explain the use of each of them.
