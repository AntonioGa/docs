#Reporting bugs

* Bugs should be reported in the mailing list: [http://groups.google.com/group/ravendb/](http://groups.google.com/group/ravendb/)
* A list of outstanding bugs can be found here: [http://issues.hibernatingrhinos.com/issues?q=project%3A+RavenDB](http://issues.hibernatingrhinos.com/issues?q=project%3A+RavenDB "http://issues.hibernatingrhinos.com/issues?q=project%3A+RavenDB")
* When reporting a bug, please include:
* * The version and build of Raven that you used (can be the build number, or the git commit hash).
* * What did you try to do?
* * What happened?
* * What did you expect to happen?
* * Details about your environment.
* Bugs that comes with a way for us to reproduce the program locally (preferably a unit test) tends to be fixed much more quickly.
