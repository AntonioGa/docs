# Deleting existing documents

Once a valid reference to a document has been retrieved, the document can be deleted with a call to `Delete` in the following manner:

{CODE deleting_document_1@Intro\BasicOperations.cs /}

Once again, this results in an HTTP communication as shown below:

	POST /bulk_docs HTTP/1.1
	Accept-Encoding: deflate,gzip
	Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
	Host: 127.0.0.1:8081
	Content-Length: 49
	Expect: 100-continue

	[{"Key":"blogs/1","Etag":null,"Method":"DELETE"}]
	
Deletes are final and cannot be rolled back, once committed.
