#Authentication & Authorization

RavenDB comes with a built-in authentication functionality and it supports two types of authentication:    
* [Windows Authentication](#windows-authentication)   
* [OAuth Authentication](#oauth-authentication)   

Appropriate authentication type is chosen by examining incoming request headers and by default all actions except read-only are being authenticated. To determine which actions will be authenticated please refer to [Raven/AnonymousAccess](../administration/configuration#authorization--authentication) configuration setting.

##Windows Authentication

When action (request) needs to be authenticated and no other authentication method is detected, then the Windows Authentication is chosen. Worth noting is that all `/admin` endpoint requests are processed using this method.

By default all windows users and groups have access to all the databases, but this can be easily changed by editing `Raven/Authorization/WindowsSettings` document in `system` database. The document consists of list of users and groups that contain the list of accessible databases. For example this document could look like this:

{CODE-START:json /}

	{
	  "RequiredGroups": [],
	  "RequiredUsers": [
		{
		  "Name": "IIS AppPool\\DefaultAppPool",
		  "Enabled": true,
		  "Databases": [
			{
			  "Admin": false,
			  "TenantId": "ExampleDB",
			  "ReadOnly": true
			}
		  ]
		}
	  ]
	}

{CODE-END /}

Above example gives a read-only access to `ExampleDB` to `IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool`. Similar effect can be achieved using the Studio and editing `system` database settings.

##OAuth Authentication

Second supported authentication type is an [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) authentication and to simplify the process, we have introduced the API key authentication described below.

###Example - API keys

To authenticate the user by using API keys we need to create a document with `Raven/ApiKeys/key_name` as a key and `ApiKeyDefinition` as a content on `system` database.

{CODE authentication_3@Server/Authentication/Index.cs /}

Now to perform any actions against specified database (`system` database must be declared explicitly), we need to provide the API key.

{CODE authentication_4@Server/Authentication/Index.cs /}
